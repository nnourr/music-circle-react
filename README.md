## About
At my last internship, I wanted to ask people about their music taste to get to know them better. However, there were a LOT of us, and I felt that it would be silly going around and asking each one what sort of music they listen to. So I created Music Circle! 

Music Circle allows anyone to create a Circle, and invite others through a link to join. Once members join, they can see their cumulative top artists, top tracks, their compatibility and a popularity ranking.

## How it works
- Music Circle gets the top 50 artists and tracks for each person that joins
- The "top ten" bar chart is generated by looping through each artist/track in every user's sorted top 50 list (sorted by most to least listened to) and assigning points to each one, in order of appearance. The more points an item has, the higher ranked it is in every person's list. The top ten highest ranked items are displayed.
- The compatilbility is calculated by doing finding the number of artists/tracks shared between every pair in the circle. The overall circle compatiblity is the average of each pairwise comparison.
